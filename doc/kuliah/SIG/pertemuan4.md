Geospatial data, GIS data or geodata has explicit geographic positioning information included within it, such as a road network from a GIS, or a geo-referenced satellite image. Geospatial data may include attribute data that describes the features found in the dataset.

We can using Python to rectrieving geospatial data, with pyshp library in it. The shapefile can be imported from natural earth. With "import shapefile" code to import the library. and "sf = shapefile.Reader('directory')" to define the path file.

After that we can use any syntax like sf.fields or sf.records to retrieve all data we need. with the algorithm too.
