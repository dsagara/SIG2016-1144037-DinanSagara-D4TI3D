MapServer is a popular Open Source project whose purpose is to display dynamic spatial maps over the Internet. Some of its major features include:

support for display and querying of hundreds of raster, vector, and database formats
ability to run on various operating systems (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, etc.)
support for popular scripting languages and development environments (PHP, Python, Perl, Ruby, Java, .NET)
on-the-fly projections
high quality rendering
fully customizable application output
many ready-to-use Open Source application environments
In its most basic form, MapServer is a CGI program that sits inactive on your Web server. When a request is sent to MapServer, it uses information passed in the request URL and the Mapfile to create an image of the requested map. The request may also return images for legends, scale bars, reference maps, and values passed as CGI variables.

MapServer can be extended and customized through MapScript or templating. It can be built to support many different vector and raster input data formats, and it can generate a multitude of output formats. Most pre-compiled MapServer distributions contain most all of its features.
